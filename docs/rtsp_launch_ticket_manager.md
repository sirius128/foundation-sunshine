# RTSP launch ticket manager

Sunshine separates the HTTPS launch transaction from the later RTSP setup.
The launch ticket manager is the single owner of state between those two
protocol phases.

## Lifecycle

```text
/launch or /resume
        |
        v
     pending  -- RTSP request authenticated --> claimed (lease count + 1)
        ^                                      |
        |---- request socket closes -----------|  (lease count - 1)
        |
        +---- stream startup confirmed --> active stream (ticket removed)
```

Only unclaimed `pending` tickets expire. Authenticated RTSP sockets hold counted
leases, so overlapping requests cannot prematurely release the ticket. The
ticket returns to `pending` when its last socket closes and remains available
until stream startup is confirmed. This is required because GameStream uses a
separate TCP connection for each RTSP request.

## Identity and compatibility

- Encrypted RTSP is claimed by successfully verifying the first request's
  AES-GCM authentication tag. The HTTPS and RTSP source addresses are only a
  candidate-order hint and are not identity.
- Plaintext legacy RTSP tickets require a unique match to the source address
  observed during `/launch` or `/resume`.
- Requests from a different or unknown source address fail closed; Sunshine
  does not fall back to an unrelated singleton ticket.
- Multiple plaintext candidates behind the same visible address fail closed;
  Sunshine never guesses and risks attaching one client's keys to another.

## Transaction invariant

`/launch` and `/resume` return success only after a ticket has been accepted by
the bounded registry. If registration fails, the endpoint returns an explicit
busy/capacity response. An application started solely for a failed `/launch`
transaction is rolled back.

## Resource bounds

The registry has a fixed global pending-ticket limit and a per-client/legacy
peer limit. Ticket expiration bounds registry lifetime, while each accepted
RTSP socket has an initial-handshake deadline to prevent idle connections from
holding resources indefinitely.

## Operational signal

The local sessions API reports `pending_sessions` separately from active stream
sessions. A healthy launch normally moves from one pending ticket to an active
session within one RTSP handshake interval.
