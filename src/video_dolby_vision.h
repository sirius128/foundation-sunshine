/**
 * @file src/video_dolby_vision.h
 * @brief Dolby Vision Profile 8.1 RPU generation for the HEVC HDR10 base layer.
 *
 * Profile 8.1 cross-compatibility mode is one HDR10-compatible HEVC Main10
 * picture plus a Dolby Vision RPU carried in an UNSPEC 62 NAL. Its value over
 * the existing HDR10+ path is not the pixels — both carry the same BT.2020/PQ
 * base layer — but handing tone mapping to the client device's native Dolby
 * Vision engine. See docs/dolby_vision_profile81.md for scope and the staged
 * rollout plan.
 *
 * The writer produces the same bytes libdovi would: RPU prefix 0x19, the
 * p8_default()/Profile81 header fields, an identity (no-op) polynomial
 * mapping so that stripping the RPU leaves a plain HDR10 stream, CM v2.9
 * extension blocks L1/L5/L6, a CRC-32/MPEG-2 trailer, and HEVC emulation
 * prevention. libdovi itself is not linked: the template is constant apart
 * from 36 bits of L1 and the scene refresh flag, so a native writer keeps the
 * streaming path free of a Rust toolchain dependency and of per-frame
 * allocations. dovi_tool remains the offline cross-check (see the unit
 * tests' independent parser).

   * above mean(PQ(nits)) on dark frames with highlights and would anchor the

   * reports zero when at least one percent of the histogram is in its near-black
